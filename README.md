# DID Alias Generator
URL: https://blackgirlbytes.github.io/did-alias-generator/
## What is this?
I'm trying to get a better understanding of DID's in Web5. I would like for my DIDs to be connected to a user-friendly alias rather than a long string of alphanumeric characters. TBD might have plans to enable this or this might not even be the most optimal solution, but this is something that will work for me going forward as I build other projects. I wan't to be able to keep track of my DIDs and have a fun aliases. Once I find a better solution, I will let folks know. 
## Technologies used
- Web5
- Next.js
- Ant Design
- GitHub Pages
## Things to improve
- This doesn't have great styling. I'm just using Ant Design System. I need to add better designs in the future.
- Validation could be improved
- Need to add tests
## Extras
-  AI to help you generate a username if you can't think of one
- ability to search for usernames maybe using fuse.js - a fuzzy search library
